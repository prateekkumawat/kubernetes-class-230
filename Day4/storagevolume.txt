# kubernetes is using volume for store data persistently. 
if we are storing data in pod without using volume in that case whatever data is genererated by kubernetes in pods will be 
wipe out because of it's container behaviour. 
that is reseon we always used persistent volume with pods and container. 

kubernetes provide various type of volume that we can use as per our requirements
1. NFS
2. Cloud storeag volumes like EBS AzureDisk GCPpersistentdisk 
3. local Direectory 
4. RBD 
5. PowerX storage and such as many more 

kubernetes support persistent Volume and persistent VOlumeClaim 

AccessMode in kubernetes
1. RWX: ReadWriteMany any node and Pod  can store data  
2. RWOP: ReadWriteOncePod only one pod can do write 
3. ROX: ReadOnlyMany  only node and pod can read data 
4. RWO: ReadWriteOnce  only one node can write and other will be only read 

Reclaim Policy: 

Delete: once you delete from pod data will be delete from pv and storage 
Retain: Once you delete data, data will be delete from pv but it will remain in storage in that case manual retain possible
Recycle: Once you delete data it will delete from pod but pv and storage keep store
